JIMMC Inventory Management System

This project was a collaborative effort for 
our Database module, where we developed 
JIMMC (Just-In-Time Management Company), 
an innovative inventory management system 
aimed at improving stock tracking and 
management for businesses.

The system features:
	•	Real-time inventory updates
	•	Automated stock level adjustments
	•	Detailed reporting and product categorization
	•	User-friendly interface and database integration

As part of the project, my role focused on 
application development, ensuring the 
functionality and usability of the system 
through efficient coding and seamless 
integration with the database. This project 
showcases our ability to apply database 
concepts to real-world business solutions.
